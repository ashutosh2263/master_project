This is my M.Tech Project under Prof. Prapanch Nair Sir 
<br>
This repository consists of a kokkos heat solver which is a 1D heat equation solver using Conjugate Gradient Method.
<br>
It uses a matrix free method to solve the problem and hence the problem becomes worthy enough to perform the parallelization.
<br>
Kokkos has been used as the parallelization and other tools like OpenMP and CUDA can be used to do the performance analysis of the code.
